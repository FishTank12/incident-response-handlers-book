The 5 W's

    Who: An organized group of unethical hackers
    What: A ransomware security incident
    Where: At a health care company
    When: Tuesday at 9:00 AM
    Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers accessed the company’s systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company’s systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers’ motivation appears to be financial since the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.

Additional Notes

All of the company’s files were encrypted. The group is a bunch of unethical hackers known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. This means we could see the same incident happening in another company related to transportation. All of the computer systems are shut down and ready to mitigate and put a stop to the incident.
